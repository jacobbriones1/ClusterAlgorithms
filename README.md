These algorithms are developed according to the *Good Clustering Principle*: Data points which are close together are clustered close together.

## Fully Developed Algorithms in `cluster.py`:
- Furthest First Travel Algorithm: `FurthestFirst(Data, k)`
- K-Means Clustering (via Lloyd's Algorithm): `lloydsAlgorithm(Data, k)`
